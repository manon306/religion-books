And wherever its position is on that ascension, the length of its sight will be, and as it ascends, many things diminish before it, things that no one sees or does except those whose souls cling to the bottom, so make it easy for it. Elevation and forgiveness, and she left her affairs to God. As for those who cannot do it, they need determination to climb out, and as for those who deny it, their hearts are the victims... if only they knew!
                            It is one journey, my friend, and whoever wants to reach a reassured soul must go through it with determination and strength, make it a continuous journey of purification, without despair or helplessness, no matter what happens in his life.</p>
